experimenting with github. can I use it to manage the scala_progfunc1 code?

25aug16: I am Craig and learning how to use GitHub while learning Scala. This has turned out to be much harder than I thought. I'm taking the Function Programming course on Coursera.org. Martin Odersky, scala designer, is the teacher.

Making another change.
